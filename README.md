# webgl-earth

An earth in space made with Three.js and WebGL.

## Installation

Start by downloading and building the project when necessary. The following
commands will do the job on most Debian based Linux distributions.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marcbperez/webgl-earth
cd webgl-earth
```

## Usage

After the installation process run the `serve` task and visit
http://localhost:8000 to browse the project pages, it is equivalent to running
Python's SimpleHTTPServer.

```bash
sudo ./gradlew serve
```

## Testing

Test checks are executed automatically every time the project is built. Builds
can be done remotely or continuously on a development context. For continuous
integration and development use docker-compose. This is recommended to keep the
system clean while the project is built every time the sources change.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

For continuous integration and development without any dependencies use the
Gradle wrapper. This is the best option if the wrapper is available and the
Docker context is not valid. For a full list of tasks, see
`sudo ./gradlew tasks --all`. For a CI cycle use `sudo ./gradlew --continuous`.

For continuous integration and development without Docker or the project wrapper
use Gradle directly. This will create the wrapper in case it is not present.
Similar to the above, for a CI cycle use `sudo gradle --continuous`. Gradle
3.4.1 is required for this to work. Plain Docker is also available for remote
integration tasks and alike. Build the image with `sudo docker build .` and run
a new container with it. Information on how to install Docker and docker-compose
can be found in their [official page][install-docker-compose]. A similar
installation guide is available [for Gradle][install-gradle].
